# Core DAO 

## Overview
Core is a revolutionary blockchain platform that combines Bitcoin's security with Ethereum's smart contract capabilities. It enables EVM-compatible smart contracts while maintaining Bitcoin's Proof of Work security model.

## Key Features

### 1. Bitcoin Integration
- **Bitcoin Mining Power**: Utilizes existing Bitcoin miners for network security
- **BTC Staking**: Non-custodial BTC staking with Dual Staking rewards
- **Bitcoin-Aligned**: Maintains Bitcoin's security principles while adding smart contract functionality

### 2. Consensus Mechanism
- **Satoshi Plus Consensus** combining:
  - Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW)
  - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
  - Non-custodial BTC staking

### 3. Security Features
- Distributed validator network
- Anti-attack mechanisms
- Checkpointing system
- Penalty system for malicious actors

### 4. Performance
- High transaction throughput
- Low latency
- Scalable architecture
- Layer 2 solutions support

### 5. Development Features
- EVM compatibility
- Solidity smart contract support
- Cross-chain communication
- Open-source codebase

## Technical Capabilities

### Smart Contracts
- Full EVM compatibility
- Support for DeFi applications
- NFT functionality
- Custom token creation

### Network Architecture
- Permissionless participation
- Community governance
- Immutable core rules
- Transparent operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of blockchain technology
- Familiarity with Solidity (for smart contract development)
- Knowledge of Bitcoin and Ethereum concepts

### Development Tools
- Solidity compiler
- Web3 development environment
- Core network access

## Community & Governance

# 🌐 Core DAO Network Configuration

This repository provides essential configuration details for adding the **CORE Chain** to your crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

---

## 🔗 Quick Setup

Add the CORE Chain to your wallet using Chainlist:

👉 [Chainlist Link](https://chainlist.org/chain/1114)

---

## ⚙️ Manual Network Configuration

If you'd prefer to add the network manually, use the following details:

* **Chain ID:** `1114`
* **RPC URL:** `https://rpc.test2.btcs.network/`
* **Block Explorer:** [`https://scan.test2.btcs.network/`](https://scan.test2.btcs.network/)

---

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure your wallet supports custom network configurations.
* Always verify URLs before use.
* This setup is intended for **testnet** purposes.

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

Here's how to add the CORE Chain manually in MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask and go to **Settings > Networks > Add Network**.
2. Enter the above configuration.
3. Save and switch to the newly added CORE Chain.
